## Barricade: A Brickwall Limiter with Transparent Sound
 
Barricade is a brickwall limiter that prevents your audio from clipping and distorting. It has a transparent sound and a low CPU usage, making it ideal for mastering and mixing. Barricade has four modes: Normal, Loud, Clip, and Safe. Normal mode is the default mode that offers a smooth and natural limiting. Loud mode boosts the perceived loudness of your audio without sacrificing dynamics. Clip mode adds a soft clipping effect that emulates analog saturation. Safe mode ensures that your audio stays below 0 dBFS at all times.
 
Barricade has four main controls: Threshold, Release, Output, and Mode. Threshold sets the level at which the limiting starts to kick in. Release sets the speed at which the limiter returns to normal after reducing the gain. Output sets the final output level of the plugin. Mode selects the limiting mode as described above. Barricade also has a meter that shows the input, output, and gain reduction levels.
 
To use Barricade, simply insert it on your master bus or any track that needs limiting. Adjust the threshold until you see some gain reduction on the meter. You can also adjust the release to fine-tune the limiting response. Choose the mode that suits your audio best. You can use Normal mode for most cases, Loud mode for more punch and impact, Clip mode for more warmth and color, or Safe mode for more headroom and safety. Finally, adjust the output level to match your desired loudness.
 
## Reverb: A Reverb Plugin with Various Algorithms and Parameters
 
Reverb is a reverb plugin that offers various algorithms and parameters to create realistic or creative reverberation effects. Reverb has six algorithms: Hall, Room, Plate, Spring, Gated, and Reverse. Hall simulates the sound of a large concert hall with a long decay time. Room simulates the sound of a small or medium-sized room with a short decay time. Plate simulates the sound of a metal plate with a bright and metallic tone. Spring simulates the sound of a spring reverb unit with a boingy and resonant character. Gated simulates the sound of a gated reverb effect that cuts off abruptly after a certain time. Reverse simulates the sound of a reversed reverb effect that builds up before the dry signal.
 
Reverb has eight main controls: Algorithm, Size, Decay, Damping, Pre-Delay, Mix, Width, and Modulation. Algorithm selects the reverb algorithm as described above. Size sets the size of the virtual space that generates the reverb. Decay sets the length of the reverb tail. Damping sets the amount of high-frequency attenuation in the reverb tail. Pre-Delay sets the delay between the dry signal and the reverb onset. Mix sets the balance between the dry and wet signals. Width sets the stereo width of the reverb effect. Modulation adds some subtle pitch modulation to the reverb tail for more naturalness.
 
To use Reverb, simply insert it on any track that needs some ambience or space. Choose an algorithm that matches your audio source and genre. For example, you can use Hall for vocals or orchestral instruments, Room for drums or guitars, Plate for synths or percussion, Spring for guitars or organs, Gated for drums or vocals, or Reverse for special effects or transitions. Adjust the size and decay to set the desired reverb length and density. Adjust the damping to control the brightness of the reverb tail. Adjust the pre-delay to create some separation between the dry and wet signals. Adjust the mix to blend in the reverb effect with your original signal. Adjust the width to create a wider or narrower stereo image of your reverb effect. Adjust the modulation to add some subtle movement and variation to your reverb tail.
